Wrapper Classes:
   Wrapper classes are object classes around primitive data types
   that have built in methods are used as objects where necessary.
   for example in Collections framework.
   Wrapper classes provides us a mechanism to use primitive data types as objects Boxing.
 Boxing:
     The automatic conversion of primitive data types into its
     equivalent Wrapper is called Boxing.
     For example
     Integer i=new Integer(10)  //Boxing
 AutoBoxing:
     The automatic conversion of primitive data types into its equivalent
     Wrapper is called autoboxing
     Integer i=10;
 Unboxing:
     The conversion of equivalent Wrapper to primitive data types is
     called unboxing
     Integer i=new Integer (10);// boxing
     int i2.value() // unboxing

  AutoUnboxing:
     The conversion of equivalent Wrapper to primitive data types
     is called unboxing
     Integer i=10; //autoboxing
     int i2=i//auto unboxing

Collection Framework
    Collection provides architecture to store and manipulate the
    group of objects that represented as a single unit
    we have many interfaces and classes inside the framework to achieve this.
  ArrayList:
    <> diamond operator is used to specify the data type in collections framework.
    ArrayList<Double> numbers=new ArrayList<>();
