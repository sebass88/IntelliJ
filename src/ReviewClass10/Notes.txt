Final Keyword:
Final keyword is used to restrict the programmers.
2)when we use it with variables we can't change their values once they are initialized
3)we can override those variables for example i can have same name variable in the child
    class without caring about the access/non-access modifiers
4) If we want to initialize the static field we can also use static initializer blocks
Final with Methods:
if we use the final keyword with methods we can't override that method in the child class
Final with class name:
if we use the final keyword with class  name we can't inherit that class. But that class
can inherit from other classes.

Abstraction:
Abstraction in Java means hiding the implementation details and providing only the
functionality to the user.
We define the input/output of a method inside the parent class and make that class as Abstract
