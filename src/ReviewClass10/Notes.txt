Final Keyword:
Final keyword is used to restrict the programmers.
2)when we use it with variables we can't change their values once they are initialized
3)we can override those variables for example i can have same name variable in the child
    class without caring about the access/non-access modifiers
4) If we want to initialize the static field we can also use static initializer blocks
Final with Methods:
if we use the final keyword with methods we can't override that method in the child class
Final with class name:
if we use the final keyword with class  name we can't inherit that class. But that class
can inherit from other classes.

Abstraction:
Abstraction in Java means hiding the implementation details and providing only the
functionality to the user.
We define the input/output of a method inside the parent class and make that class as Abstract
then implementation is provided in the child classes.
To Create the abstract class we use the abstract keyword  it's a non access modifier.
Rules:
  1) we can create a class as abstract even without having any abstract methods.
  2) we can have static and non-static methods and fields inside the abstract class.
  3) we can have constructors as well inside the abstract classes.
  4) We can't have a class or method as final and abstract at the same time.  (Interview Question)
  5) They must participate in inheritance and provide the implementation for the abstract methods.
  6) If we don't want to provide the implementation to all the methods in the child class
  we can declare that class as abstract class.
  7) If we have even one single abstract method that class must be abstract (Interview Question)
  8) We can't create the objects of abstract classes ,we must have a child class
  that inherits from that class and provide the implementation for all the methods then
  only we can create its object.

InterFace
if 2 entities don't have parent child relationship we can create an interface
for those entities.

Encapsulation:
Encapsulation is using data (variables/fields) and code(methods) together as a single
