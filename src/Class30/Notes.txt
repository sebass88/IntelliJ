Why learn fileHnadling in Java:
1) Putting sensitive info inside the code is not a good idea because everyone
who has the access to the code will be able to see them.

2) Every time we test our applications on different environment we have to change
the code to update the credentials ,It's also not an idea and can introduce bugs.

We will be discussing two types of files

1) Properties file
2)Excel file

Properties file
Data is stored in the form of key and value pairs
  To read the data from any file
    We should know the path then we can use FileInputStream Class to load that file
    inside Java program.
FileInputStream:
 loads the data inside the program in the form of bytes
 Properties.load()method data is converted to key-value pairs
 , and we can use the methods from Map Interface to read and write the data.
