		//We have 4 access levels in java and 3 keywords to control these access levels
		// Private,Proctected,Default(which is not a keyword),Public.
		
		// 1.Private
		//if we write private keyword with any class member it can be accessed only in that class.
		
		// 2.Default:
		// if we do not write any keyword with class members we can access those members inside
		// the same class and in any other class inside the same page.
		
		//3.Public:
		//if we use public keyword with any class member that member is accessible everywhere in the project.
		
		//Best Practices:
		// always try to declare the fields as private
		// most of the methods are declared as Public
