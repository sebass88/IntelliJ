Sets:
    Sets in java are special data structures that do not allow duplicate elements.
    There are 3 main type of Sets
    1.HashSet
    2.LinkedHashSet
    3.Tree Set

HashSet:
    Fast but no insertion order

LinkedHashSet:
    Slower that Hashset but retains the insertion order

TreeSet:
    Sorts the elements in natural order
===================================================
Map is a data structure that stores the element in the form of key and value pairs

Most Famous type of maps are
1) HashMap
2)LinkedHashMap
3) TreeMap
4) HashTable

HashMap:
    Insertion order is not maintain but they are the fastest most widely used.

LinkedHashMap:
    Maintains the insertion order but are slower than HashMap.

Tree Map:
    Sorts the data based on keys insertion its very slow retrieval is comparable to HashMap.

HashTable:
    Hashtables are thread safe.

FileHandling:
  Reading manipulating and writing data to files is called File Handling in Java.
  Path=location of that file on our computer
  If we want to read the data from files we need FileInputStream
  If we want to read
