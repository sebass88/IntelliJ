Abstraction is a process that hides implementation details and shows only
the functionality to the user.

Abstract Classes:
    1)Abstract classes in java are classes with Abstract keyword.
    2)We use abstract classes when we are sure about the method header, but not implementation.
    3)We can declare a class as abstract class without having any abstract
    methods inside it.
    4)Once we have at least one abstract method we must declare that class as abstract.
    5)We can have non-abstract methods as well inside the abstract class.
    6)We need a child class to provide implementation of abstract methods.
    7)The child class can provide the implementation for all the methods or
       it can leave some methods unimplemented.
    8) We can't have a class or method final and abstract at the same time.
    9) We can't use abstract keyword with fields and constructors.
    10) Abstract methods don't have body in the parent class.
    11) Abstract is a non-access modifier.
